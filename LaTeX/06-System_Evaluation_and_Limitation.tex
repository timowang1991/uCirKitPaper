\section{System Limitation}
Although \papertitle\ proves to be a convenient and easy to use prototyping tool, the cost for the required materials is high. For a bottle of Silver Nano Particle Ink (100 ml) the sale price is 300 USD. Additional costs of purchasing a compatible printer and customized \papertitle PCB further increase the system cost.

The printed Silver Nano Particle Ink material is not suited for extensive prototyping due to the high resistance. Therefore until there is new technology in material sciences, this material is better suited for analog circuits.

Assembly time is an area of concern due to the need for a secure and tight assembly. The use of screws and caps (FIX NAME) requires additional time to be included in the prototyping process.
