\section{System Limitation}
%Although \papertitle\ proves to be convenient and easy to use, the cost for the required materials is high. For a bottle of Silver Nano Particle Ink (100 ml) the sale price is 300 USD. Additional costs of purchasing a compatible printer, printing paper and customized \papertitle\ PCB further increase the system cost.

The cost for obtaining \papertitle's required materials is high. A bottle of Silver Nano Particle Ink (100 ml)  costs 300 USD. Additional costs of a compatible printer, printing paper and customized PCB further increase the system cost.

%The printed Silver Nano Particle Ink material is not suited for extensive prototyping due to the high resistance. Therefore until there is new technology in material sciences, this material is better suited for analog circuits.

Silver Nano Particle Ink is not suited for extensive prototyping due to the high resistance and is better suited for analog circuits.

%Assembly time is an area of concern due to the need for a secure and tight assembly. The use of screws and caps (FIX NAME) requires additional time to be included in the prototyping process.

The use of screws and caps (FIX NAME) requires significant assembly time to be included in the prototyping process.
