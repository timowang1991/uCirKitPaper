\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to 3D proto- typing, i.e. to print wireframe representations instead of a filled model and to extrude filament directly into 3D space instead of printing layer-wise. Our validation shows that in combination, these two approaches indeed lead to a sub- stantial speed up of up to a factor of 10 and thus allow designers to iterate more often.

For future work, we plan to explore how fast 3D printing allows for novel types of interfaces that close the feedback loop between digital editing and physical fabrication.
